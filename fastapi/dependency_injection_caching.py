# cache??
# https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/1635#issuecomment-739537045
#
# That cache is only used per-request. It only avoids, for example, getting the user from DB several times in dependencies and sub-dependencies to handle a single request.
#
# But all that will be executed again for the next request. So it's fine to leave it. You should set use_cache=False only when you have some specific reason to make a dependency function execute more than once in a single request.
#
# In fact, I have never found a real use case for it. I thought there would be one at some point, but it hasn't happened so far. ðŸ¤·
